# Personal-Projects
A collection of personal programming projects demonstrating various programming skills and interests. This repository serves as a portfolio of coding work and learning experiences.

## Projects
* **Arduino:**
    * **Skills USA Competition Program:** The program I wrote to controll my robot for the competition. (Versions 0 through 4).
    * **Libraries:** Contains all of the necesary libraries to run the code on the Tetrix Prism Board among other boards used.
 
* **Spam Machine:**
    * All of the versions of Spam Machine. It's a program that asked what message you want to send then gives some time to select the text box you want the text pasted in. Then it starts sending it for as many times as you selected. It has a timer in between messages to make it less prone to getting recognized as a bot.

*Projects will be added as they are developed*

## Purpose
This repository showcases my programming journey, problem-solving approaches, and coding style through practical applications. Each project demonstrates different aspects of software development, from basic programming concepts to more complex implementations.

## Technologies
*Technologies will be added as new projects are included*
