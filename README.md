Welcome to my **Personal Projects** repository ‚Äî a growing collection of my programming experiments, creative builds, and technical problem-solving exercises.  
This serves both as a **portfolio of my coding work** and a **journal of my learning journey**.

## üìÇ Projects

<details>
  <summary><strong>Arduino Projects</strong> üöÄ</summary>

  - **SkillsUSA Competition Program**
    - A full program developed to control my competition robot. (Versions 0 through 5+)
    - Includes two support programs:
      - **DC Motor Expansion Controller ID Changer:** Changes the board ID for proper addressing and control during competition.
      - **Info Reader:** Reads diagnostic information from devices connected to the Tetrix Prizm board.

  - **Libraries**
    - A collection of required libraries to run the code, primarily for the Tetrix Prizm board and other Arduino-compatible hardware.

  <summary><strong>Spam Machine</strong> ü§ñ</summary>

  - A multi-version program that automates text sending:
    - **Functionality:** 
      - Asks the user for a message.
      - Provides time to select a target textbox.
      - Repeatedly pastes the message with a customizable delay to reduce bot detection risk.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Showcase my **coding skills**, **creative thinking**, and **problem-solving approaches**.
- Demonstrate my **growth** in software development, from fundamental concepts to more advanced projects.
- Serve as a **personal archive** of the different technologies and strategies I explore.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Arduino / Tetrix Prizm Platform**
- **Python** (for Spam Machine)

> *More technologies will be listed as new projects are added!*

## üìå Notes

This repository is an evolving space ‚Äî part workshop, part museum, part launchpad for whatever I dream up next.

---

## üîÆ Future Plans (Coming Soon!)
- Expand the Arduino section with new competition features.
- Add more Python-based utilities and tools.
- Start working with web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript mini-projects).
- Maybe even a few game development experiments!
